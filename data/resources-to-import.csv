Working with categorical data in R without losing your mind,"Categorical data, called “factor” data in R, presents unique challenges in data wrangling. R users often look down at tools like Excel for automatically coercing variables to incorrect datatypes, but factor data in R can produce very similar issues. The stringsAsFactors=HELLNO movement and standard Tidyverse defaults have moved us away from the use of factors, but they are sometimes still necessary for analysis. This talk will outline common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, and show strategies to avoid them, using both base R and the Tidyverse (particularly, dplyr and forcats functions).",Factors,Learning Resource,Amelia McNamara,,"tidyverse,forcats",https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/working-with-categorical-data-in-r-without-losing-your-mind/,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rru-website/master/plots/working-with-categorical-data-in-r-without-losing-your-mind.png,plots/working-with-categorical-data-in-r-without-losing-your-mind.png
Wrangling categorical data in R,"Data wrangling is a critical foundation of data science, and wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this process. However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.",Factors,Learning Resource,"Amelia McNamara,Nicholas Horton",,"tidyverse,forcats",https://peerj.com/preprints/3163,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rru-website/master/plots/wrangling-categorical-data-in-r.png,plots/wrangling-categorical-data-in-r.png
